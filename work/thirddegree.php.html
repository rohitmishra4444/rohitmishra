    <h2>Third Degree Fitness</h2>

    <h3>Project Type: Branding, Web Design & Development, Design, Photography & Video</h3>

    <p><strong>Scope-</strong> Third Degree needed to bring a fresh take on what it meant to be a boutique fitness concept.</p>

    <p>Here's some insight into the creation of Third Degree Fitness, a boutique fitness concept in the heart of River North, Chicago.  This project is still ongoing but I will continue to post work throughout the completion and show some of the thought that has gone into the strategy of creating this concept.</p>

    <blockquote>The Future Of Group Fitness</blockquote>

    <h4>Branding</h4>

    <p>We had a lot of research to do in order to come up with a solid branding strategy for Third Degree.  There was a lot of competition in the marketplace and we needed to really drive home the point that our concept was like nothing else in the city.  Since group fitness classes were all that would be offered for workouts at the studio, there needed to be that group, community vibe that made members feel like they were a part of something and not just anoter member.  Also having three of the best, and most cohesive fitness discplines under one roof was something that needed to be emphasized.</p>
    <blockquote>Lots of people just cycle, or just do yoga, but we wanted to encourage a well-rounded, sustainable routine that would drive results</blockquote>
    <p>Before we picked colors, or font treatments, or did anything related to creative execution, we needed to really nail down our ideal member.  After creating this <a href="http://www.drewtempleton.com/downloads/TD_Target_Analysis.pdf">target analysis,</a> we had a clear picture of where we wanted to be and how we'd get there.</p> 
    <img class="work-image" src="../images/work/thirddegree/thirddegree6.jpg">
    <p class="work-image-info">Who is this "member?"</p>
    <p>After we had painted a clear picture of our target demographic and then created user stories, the team was on the same page in a direction to head.</p>
    <blockquote>The logo represents all three disciplines combining to create one, cohesive and powerful fitness experience.</blockquote>
    <p>The creation of the branding guidelines, although still a work in progress, started heading us down a creative path.  Check out the branding guidelines <a href="http://www.drewtempleton.com/downloads/TD_Brand_Defined.pdf">here.</a></p>

    <h4>Web / UX</h4>

    <p>Third Degree's web presence was going to be one of the big selling points for the studio.  The Third Degree web app will allow users to reserve their specific spot in class ahead of time.  No more leaving work earlier than intended just to make sure you have a spot in class.  No more showing up to a packed Yoga studio and being stuck in the corner or having a butt a little too close to your face.</p>
    <p>During the development of the production web app, a <a href="http://www.thirddegreefitness.com">pre-opening marketing based page</a> was developed to showcase the concept and to promote our partnership with our bike partner, <a href="http://www.pelotoncycle.com">Peloton.</a></p>
    <p>This <a href="../downloads/Third_Degree_Wireframes_Desktop.pdf">interaction flow</a> was created to blaze the path for the app.</p>
    <img class="work-image" src="../images/work/thirddegree/thirddegree3.jpg">
    <p class="work-image-info">Layout the steps</p>
    <p>There has been a lot of iterations of mockups through the door since the start of this project.  We haven't landed on one yet, but I'll be sure to post what we do land on when the time is here.  Here's a look at some of the different looks we've gone though.</p>

    <img class="work-image" src="../images/work/thirddegree/thirddegree4.jpg">
    <p class="work-image-info">and more looks..</p>

    <h4>Photography</h4>
    
    <p>More photography will be coming soon.  This photograph was taken of our Director Of Fitness, Antonia DeSantis as she showcased the Peloton bike at the Lululemon store in Chicago.</p>

    <p class="work-image-info">Pedal on</p>
    

    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>Clothes, interior and exterior design, car wraps, you name it we've been hands on with it.  The interior design team, <a href="http://olsenvranas.com/">Olson Vranas</a> worked with me to create a cohesive interior/exterior design package that coincided with Third Degree's branding guidelines.</p>
    <img class="work-image" src="../images/work/thirddegree/thirddegree8.jpg">
    <p class="work-image-info">That's a nice looking building..</p>
    <p>We also had a little fun with some shirt designs and a car wrap for a Smart Car that you might see us driving around town.</p>
    <img class="work-image" src="../images/work/thirddegree/thirddegree5.jpg">
    <p class="work-image-info">Release the beast</p>
    <img class="work-image" src="../images/work/thirddegree/thirddegree1.jpg">
    <p class="work-image-info">Beep beep</p>

    <p>Expect a lot more to come from Third Degree as we progress.  Being passionate about fitness and about my work for this project, I am excited to show you the steps as we progress and to see you beside me sweating when we open the doors.</p>
